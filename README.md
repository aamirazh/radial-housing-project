## To set up the database in PostgreSQL:
Our leafletJS front-end passes location coordinates to the Flask/SQLAlchemy API, which queries our database.

Make sure the 13 CSV files from census_data_files.zip in the are in the same directory as create.sql, load.sql, and setup.sh in housingdb. In the VM, run setup.sh.

The schema for the database are in the nhgis text files in the housingdb folder.

## Site/API:
Install Flask and SQLAlchemy as described on the [course site](https://sites.duke.edu/compsci316_01_f2017/help/flask/) . Then, install [CensusGeocode](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/censusgeocode) and [geopy](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/geopy).

From the FlaskAPI directory, run app.py.  
To launch the webpage, open index.html (from the "html" folder) in a browser. Make sure that your CSS, html, and js folders are all in in the same folder.
